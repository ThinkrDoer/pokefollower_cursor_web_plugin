# Vibecode Project Overview

*(purpose: a single-page source of truth for what this initiative is, why it exists, and what success means)*

---

## 1. Purpose & Vision

VIBECODE is an experimental learning and creation lab that blends **product thinking** with **AI-assisted software development**.

The aim is to understand the full cycle of building digital products — from idea to live demo — without requiring deep engineering experience.

Ultimately, the goal is to:

- Learn how AI tools (e.g., GPTs, Bolt.new, Replit, etc.) can accelerate development.
- Build a **portfolio of small, functioning apps** (web apps, extensions, or plug-ins).
- Create a **repeatable playbook** for rapid prototyping using a “vibecoding” approach.

*→ This aligns expectations and gives direction whenever scope discussions arise.*

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

1. **Ship to learn.** We value tangible experiments over perfect plans.
2. **Simplicity first.** Prefer micro-apps with one clear function and visible output.
3. **Document as we go.** Every step produces reusable knowledge.
4. **Stay ethical and IP-safe.** No copyrighted materials unless clearly permitted.
5. **Free-tier until justified.** Cost discipline reinforces creative constraints.
6. **Curiosity over speed.** It’s fine if progress is slow, as long as we understand what we’re doing.

*→ These act like cultural values for our mini-team; they influence every decision.*

## 3. Objectives & Key Outcomes

| Objective | Measurable Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Learn the basics of AI-assisted development | Successfully set up a working development environment (GitHub + Codespaces) |
| Produce a tangible first project | A working Chrome/Firefox extension with a documented build process |
| Develop repeatable process | A complete set of templates (PRD, Issue, Release) reused for future builds |
| Build a foundation for future micro-projects | Ability to clone structure and spin up new ideas quickly |

*→ This is our mini-OKR table. It defines “done” for the overall project.*

## 4. Project Scope

**In Scope**

- Browser extensions or small web apps.
- Free-tier tooling (GitHub, Codespaces, Vercel, etc.).
- Learning-focused builds (non-commercial).
- Simple front-end and lightweight JavaScript/TypeScript logic.

**Out of Scope**

- Complex backends or full databases.
- Paid infrastructure unless later approved.
- Commercial distribution or monetization.
- Use of copyrighted assets (Pokémon IP, etc.) without safe alternatives.

*→ This clarifies boundaries early and avoids technical rabbit holes.*

## 5. Stakeholders & Roles

| Role | Person/Entity | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product Lead | You | Provide ideas, define scope, approve milestones |
| Technical Partner | GPT-5 (ChatGPT) | Guide development, provide code, explain concepts |
| Reviewer (optional) | Future collaborators | Give feedback or testing support |

*→ In real teams this is a RACI; here it’s a simple accountability map.*

---

## 6. Success Criteria

The project is considered successful when:

1. A working browser extension is installed locally and functions as intended.
2. All project templates are tested in at least one build.
3. A clear learning report (what worked, what confused you) is written.
4. Future micro-projects can start from this base with minimal friction.

---

## 7. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Over-scoping or perfectionism | Define strict MVP and DoD per project |
| Tool overwhelm | Limit active tools to 3–4 until comfortable |
| Copyright/IP issues | Use original or open-source assets |
| Burnout / loss of motivation | Keep projects short and celebrate small wins |
