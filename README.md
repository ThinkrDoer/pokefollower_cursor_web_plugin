### Welcome, Trainer! 👋

Thanks for checking out **PokéFollower** - a browser extension that brings a little nostalgic joy to your browsing experience with cute retro 2D Pokémon sprites that follow your cursor around the web.

### About This Project

PokéFollower started as a personal experiment to recapture that warm, playful feeling of having a companion by your side while you work and browse. Whether you're working on a project, browsing social media, or just need a small friend to keep you company, ***PokéFollower is here to make your screen time a bit more fun.*** It was my girlfriends idea, after I mentioned I wanted to make a plugin.

### About Me

My name is **Ali,**. I am trying to build more things in my life, and this plugin was one of my first accomplishments in learning how to do so.
